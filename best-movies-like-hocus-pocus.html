The first of many movies in the beloved franchise is a must-watch for fans of Hocus Pocus. It takes place 25 years after Gomez and his brother Fester have a falling out, and the latter returns to the family, much to everyone’s joy. However, when Fester has trouble remembering important family moments, he arouses suspicion and questions on whether he is an impostor.

This stop-motion animation is set in Halloween Town, ruled by the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington. When Jack gets bored with his realm and discovers Christmas Town, he becomes obsessed with their traditions and kidnaps Santa Claus. The musical has a cult following and is an integral part of many people’s spooky holiday traditions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Craft</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>The Craft leans more towards horror than some of the campier movies on this list, and follows four teenage girls who are outcasts in their school for different reasons. The girls find out that they each have magical abilities and form a witch coven to practice their craft together. Things begin to take a strange turn when their spells start having negative consequences, not only on the people around them, but on themselves.

In this epic fantasy, Maleficent, hurt and betrayed by the man she loved, seeks revenge against him, but comes to fall in love with Aurora, forming a strong mother-daughter bond with her.
