He was also mentioned in Forbes Magazine ‘Top Ten CEOs’ list. Ergen co-founded the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1953</span><p>Ergen was born into an Episcopalian family in Oak Ridge, <a href=#>Tennessee</a>, on March 1, 1953, the fourth of five children born to Viola (née Siebenthal) and <a href=#>william</a> Krasny Ergen. His mother was one of the first female accountants in the state of <a href=#>Minnesota</a>. His <a href=#>Father</a> was an <a href=#>Austrian</a> immigrant who was working in <a href=#>Sweden</a> as a nuclear <a href=#>Physicist</a>, and left Europe prior to World War II. His <a href=#>Father</a> coined the phrase "China Syndrome". His parents married in <a href=#>Minnesota</a> in 1944 and then moved to Camden, New Jersey, before settling in Oak Ridge where his <a href=#>Father</a> accepted a position at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Ergen received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of <a href=#>Tennessee</a> at Knoxville, and an M.B.A. from Wake Forest University. He was a professional blackjack and poker player.</p><span>1980</span><p>In 1980 Ergen, his <a href=#>Future</a> wife Candy, and Jim Defranco started a new <a href=#>Business</a> called EchoSphere Corporation, investing $60,000 to purchase two C-Band antennas, targeting rural <a href=#>Colorado</a>. They drove around the Denver metro area on a small budget, selling satellite dishes from the back of their truck.</p><span>1990</span><p>In 1990 Ergen pushed EchoStar into the big leagues by raising $335 million in <a href=#>Jun K</a> bonds and purchasing orbital slots for satellites. Two years later, EchoStar got a DBS license from the Federal Communications Commission, giving the company its own geostationary orbital slot. In 1993, EchoStar Communications was incorporated. Under Ergen, EchoStar’s net income doubled to $20.4 million, in 1993.</p><span>1991</span><p>In June 1991, Ergen was named ‘Master <a href=#>Entrepreneur</a> of the Year’ for the Rocky Mountain region by INC Magazine. Two years prior, he had been honoured with a Home Satellite TV Association Star Award. Ergen played a key role in fighting for <a href=#>American</a> consumers’ rights to watch local television channels via satellite, which became a reality after the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act was passed in 1999. He has been an advocate of video competition issues and testified before the Congress, in this regard, on numerous occasions. He was recognized with a Rocky Mountain News’ <a href=#>Business</a> Person of the Year Award in 1996, and honoured a second time in 2001.</p><span>2001</span><p>Ergen also won the Frost & Sullivan 2001 CEO of the Year of the Satellite Industry. In 2000 he was named ‘Space Industry <a href=#>Business</a> Man of the Year.’ Ergen was named one of the ‘World’s Best CEOs’ by Barron’s magazine in 2007. He was also mentioned in Forbes Magazine ‘Top Ten CEOs’ list. Ergen co-founded the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association.</p><span>2012</span><p>Under Ergen, DISH was the first satellite provider to offer two-way high-speed internet access and the first to introduce a Digital video recorder in a set-top box. He was also instrumental in making satellite receivers available for under $200. In 2012, the Big Four Broadcasters, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox filed a suit against Dish Network after it launched AutoHop, a <a href=#>Technology</a> that records broadcasting programming and plays it back without commercials. DISH filed a suit seeking a declaratory judgment asserting the legality of the judgment. Preliminary injunction by Fox to block the <a href=#>Service</a> was denied. Ergen has stated that DISH’s present focus is on acquiring a significant share of the spectrum for cellular wireless services. Dish is also looking for a partner to build a wireless network, with Google and AT&T speculated to be potential partners.</p><span>2013</span><p>Ergen is perceived as being difficult and unpredictable in negotiations. AT&T attempted to acquire Dish only to have the deal fall apart at the last minute. In 2013, Ergen angered his counterparts in negotiations to acquire Sprint by making a direct bid for Sprint's Clearwire subsidiary. Dish later walked out of those negotiations. Ergen's supporters call his negotiating style patient and prudent.</p><span>2014</span><p>With an estimated 2014 net worth of $17B, Ergen is reportedly the wealthiest person in <a href=#>Colorado</a>.</p><span>2019</span><p>He is married to Cantey ("Candy") McAdam. They have five children. They live in Littleton, <a href=#>Colorado</a>. Ergen is an avid mountain climber who has scaled Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Aconcagua in <a href=#>Argentina</a> and Mount Everest base camp in Nepal. He is a member of the <a href=#>Colorado</a> Mountain Club and has climbed all of Colorado’s 14,000-foot peaks. Besides mountain climbing, his interests include poker and pickup basketball.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1953 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American billionaires</a> <a href=#>American businesspeople</a> <a href=#>American Episcopalians</a> <a href=#>American people of Austrian descent</a> <a href=#>American chief executives</a> <a href=#>American mass media owners</a> <a href=#>People from Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a> <a href=#>University of Tennessee alumni</a> <a href=#>Wake Forest University alumni</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTna6zuMSsZJ6ql5q7brrErWSwp6KptW6Bj2tsbQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./do-i-need-to-watch-trigun-before-trigun-stampede.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do I need to watch Trigun before Trigun Stampede?">&larr;
