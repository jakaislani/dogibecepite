While that can also vary from baby to baby, it's helpful to have an idea of what to expect.<h2>Do all babies say mama?</h2>But there is a word, and only one, spoken the same way in nearly every language known to humankind. That word, of course, is "mama." "Mama" is a universal word, describing the woman who gave us the most cherished love in our most vulnerable state. Almost every language boasts a recognizable form of it.<h2>Why won't my child say mama?</h2>Your toddler might have any number of reasons for why they don't call you mama: Possibility #1 -Conceptually the child has not made the connection between this particular word and his actual mother.
