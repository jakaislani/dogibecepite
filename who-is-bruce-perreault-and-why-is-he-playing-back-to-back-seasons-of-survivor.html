For starters, some of his favorite hobbies are golf and boxing, and his biggest pet peeve is when people scratch their teeth with their fork while eating, however, Bruce was much more vulnerable in these bios as well, sharing information about his upbringing, his family, and more.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Bruce revealed that he was “abandoned as a child” and a member of the foster care system, until he was eventually adopted by a white family — an experience that has truly shaped him into the man he is today. In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Parade</a>, Bruce gushed about this experience, as well as how it has prepared him to play Survivor:</p><p>“I was abandoned as a child, and I was placed into the foster care system, and before being placed into the foster care system, I was abandoned for about three days… It was a level of survival there, even though I didn’t know it. I was at the age of two, but growing up in the foster care system, you gain a sense of being able to survive, because you never know how long you’re gonna be with the person that is there with you. … You tend to learn how to kind of grow bonds when you know they’re going to be there. But then you also tend not to grow those bonds when you know it’s only a short-term situation.”</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>Now, with two kids of his own and a wife that he loves oh-so dearly, Bruce is the father and husband that he has always dreamed of.
