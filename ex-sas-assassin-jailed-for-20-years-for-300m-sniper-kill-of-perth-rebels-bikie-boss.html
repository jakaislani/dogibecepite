to the murder of Mr Martin at Perth Motorplex last December.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>‘The charges relate to the [alleged] payment of that murder,’ he said. ‘And also

hadn’t agree to testify against Pye at a later date because of the ‘extraordinary seriousness of the offending’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said the offer to work the authorities was ‘exceptional and deserving of a very significant discount’ – but warned the 30 year sentence could still be imposed if he failed to follow through with his side of the deal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutor Justin Whalley revealed the killer had been recruited by Pye and the pair had kept in touch by an encrypted phone app.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pye offered the killer $10,000 for research and surveillance of Martin to plan the hit, said Mr Whalley, including visiting the target’s home and flying a drone over the property.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two weeks before the killing, the assassin did a reconnaissance visit to the motor racing complex and watched Martin from just 10m away as he added the finishing touches to the lethal plan.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ex-soldier was part of soldier of fortune outfit Shadows of Hope, which calls itself ‘the world’s most dangerous and fearless charity’.</p><p
