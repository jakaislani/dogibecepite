The media mogul also earns millions of dollars from making posts on social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook,&nbsp;and Twitter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kim-kardashians-ethnic-roots-and-family-background></span> <strong>Kim Kardashian’s </strong><strong>Ethnic Roots And Family Background&nbsp;</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kim K was born Kimberly Noel Kardashian, on October 21, 1980, in Los Angeles, California. She is the second of four children&nbsp;born to Robert and Kris Kardashian (later Jenner).&nbsp;Kim’s father was Armenian while her mum has a mix of German and Irish bloodlines.&nbsp;Consequently, the social media queen is of mixed ethnicity and ancestry which include Armenian, German, and Irish origins.</p><p>Kim Kardashian grew up in&nbsp;Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and was a preschool classmate of socialite&nbsp;Paris Hilton who introduced her to the social scene. She attended Marymount High School,&nbsp;Roman Catholic, girl’s school. After graduating from high school, she worked as a wardrobe stylist&nbsp;and an assistant to Paris Hilton.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kim-kardashians-parents></span><strong>Kim Kardashian’s Parents</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kim Kardashian’s father was a successful trial lawyer who became famous for helping defend O.J. Simpson during his 1995 murder trial. She has an older sister,&nbsp;Kourtney, a younger sister Khloé and&nbsp;a younger brother Robert. Her parents divorced in 1991, and her mother Kris, a socialite and the family’s business manager, married Olympic gold medalist, Bruce Jenner now known as Caitlyn Jenner in the same year. The union produced Kim’s half-sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. In 2003, Kim’s father died of cancer. After their father’s death, Kim and her sisters, Khloé and Kourtney, opened a clothing boutique called D-A-S-H and a number of other branded products, including nail polishes, cupcakes, clothing, furniture, books, etc, in the city of Calabasas near Los Angeles&nbsp;which was later expanded to several other locations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-to-know-about-kim-kardashians-height-weight-measurements></span><strong>What To Know About Kim Kardashian’s Height, Weight & Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kimberly Kardashian is not one of your tallest celebrity favorites neither is she the shortest.
