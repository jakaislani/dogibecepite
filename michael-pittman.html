Scroll below and check more detailed information about Current Net worth as well as Monthly/Year Salary, Expenses, Income Reports!</span></h3><h2><span id=Michael_Pittman_biography_and_early_life>Michael Pittman biography and early life</span></h2><p><strong>Michael Pittman</strong>, Jr professionally from Michael Pittman, was born to the parents Michael Pittman, Sr. and Kristin Randall in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California. Pittman Jr grew up with his four brothers, Mycah Pittman, Jett Pittman, and Mykava Pittman, along with his parents. His father is also a former American soccer player who played back in the running position. Interestingly, Pittman, Jr was born six months before Arizona chose his father in the fourth round of the 1998 NFL draft. In addition, the large recipient grew up and was highly influenced by his father. Seeing his father play in the NFL encouraged him to play football. He, therefore, determined since the early days to follow his father’s direction to become a footballer as he was.</p><p>His father was also pleased with his growing enthusiasm for the game. He still coached him about the NFL and shared his experience as a successful soccer player. In one of his interviews, Michael mentioned his dad, saying,</p><p>He has cooked me a lot of time to my life in the NFL, to sell with coaches, to live a room in the locomotive, to teach me practically to be a PLAYER FOOTBALL In MY WHOLE life.”</p><p>As for his career, for his first time in Valencia High School and for his sophomore, junior, and senior years in Oaks Christian School. Similarly, following his graduation, Pittman Jr enrolled in Southern California University.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_Michael_Pittman_Age_and_height>How old is Michael Pittman? Age and height</span></h2><p>Established in 1997, Michael is currently 23 years old. Also, on October 5, the large recipient shares his birthday, making his birth sign Libra. And they are known for being talented, enthusiastic, and courageous from what we know.</p><p>Although he is young, Michael has got a superb athletic body structure and can easily set up his defensemen to protect the ball using his height. The talented large recipient also stands at an astonishing height of 6 feet (1.93 m), 101 kg (222 lbs), which is considered to be proportional to its height.<br>Pittman still retains the right balance and outstanding body coordination in the field when thinking about his skills. Furthermore, the American native has an amazing pace and can sink his hips and get defensemen off the line by changing his speed. Likewise, Pittman is not only good at his pace but also quick at his hands. Not to mention, his hands are among the best in the class. Besides, Michael has short light brown hair and a couple of black eyes. However, anything like his body and other measurements for public knowledge is not yet available.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Pittman_Football_Career>Michael Pittman Football Career</span></h2><p>Back in his early career, Michael played soccer from high school. He also took part in the All-American Bowl at a young age and was named the first all-American team by Parade. He was also named USA Today All-California Offensive Player of the Year for the 2015-2016 season. Likewise, after registering for the USC, Pittman had the best matches for the game. In 2017, he played a critical role as a wide receiver and was the first All-Pac-12 team in 2017. Similarly, he has also been named Player of the Year as a USC Co-Special Teams.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Pittman_Net_worth_and_salary>Michael Pittman Net worth and salary</span></h2><p>Michael has had a very good soccer career since his college days and was destined to make him even brighter later. Though Michael is only 23 years old, he has enjoyed a lot of success since his college, high school, and now a professional career.</p><p>Sadly, the exact net value of Michael in 2020 is uncertain because of his previous financial income. However, reports show that he now receives an annual salary of $610,000 for the Indianapolis Colts as a broad receiver.</p><p>Furthermore, it signed a four-year agreement with the Indianapolis Colts priced at $8,162 million, including an average annual salary of $3,823,892 as a Signing Bonus of $5,825,385 as a guaranteed income.</p><p>This is also just the beginning of his NFL career. Michael has therefore been left for several years to make his mark in the league and gain even more money in years to come. Nevertheless, since Pittman has reached the major league, we should expect his net value to grow in the next few years.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Pittman_Girlfriend_and_personal_life>Michael Pittman Girlfriend and personal life</span></h2><p>Michael fans are curious about his personal life and love, just like any other NFL fan. The talented talents, impressive personality, and charming looks of Pittman have taken him many women down. Similarly, it’s no wonder he’s a crush on many people. Well, many hearts are broken to know that Michael is taken.</p><p>In particular, the talented, broad-based recipient is pleased with his old friend Kianna Pittman. In addition, in October 2020 they recently participated, with Kianna revealing her ring in her social media post.</p><p>Unfortunately, no information is available about how and when Michael and Kianna met. But they celebrated their seventh anniversary this year alone, so during their teens, they must have known each other.</p><p>Kianna also traveled with Michael from the beginning of his career and used to assist him during his soccer matches. She appeared to be Pittman’s biggest fan. In addition, the pair also fly together to interesting places to spend their vacation. For example, you will realize how deeply loving and happy these two are with each other if you look at one of their social media handles.</p><p>So, we hope that they will soon marry and deepen their strong bond. However, in their love life or wedding, if anything important comes out, we will update it here.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_Presence>Social media Presence</span></h2><p>Michael Pittman is very active on social media platforms and wants to keep them up to date.
