Throughout his life, he had romantic relationships with several women, but he only married three of them. He met Laura, his first wife, when he was a juvenile offender in California. He then got married to a woman by the name of Joanne in 1975.</p><p>The pair split up after three years, and he eventually got married to Debbie Shreve in 1997. He is no longer with Debbie in 2022; the two parted ways in 2009.</p><h2><span id=Career_As_a_young_actress_Danielle_Trejo_began_her_acting_career>Career: As a young actress, Danielle Trejo began her acting career.</span></h2><p>Danielle, Danny’s 12-year-old daughter, made her acting debut in 2002. Her father played a small-town barber in Colombia in the short film Simplicity, where she made her acting debut as a granddaughter.</p><p>It took her ten years after her debut to work on the next film. Eventually, she starred with her father, Electra Avellan, Margaret Cho, and James Duval in the film Amelia’s 25th in 2012.</p><p>She also made an appearance as Manny’s Entourage in Strike One in 2014. After that, in 2016, she worked on the short Frankie Teardrop and the movie 1st Strike. She didn’t work on any other film projects after this.</p><p>Danielle has performed as a customer in addition to playing in the 2014 movie Bullet.

She was additionally highlighted in the documentary Inmate # 1: The Rise of Danny Trejo.</p><h2><span id=Danielle_Trejo_is_she_married_Who_Is_Her_Spouse>Danielle Trejo, is she married? Who Is Her Spouse?</span></h2><p>Danny’s stunning daughter is thirty-two years old. It follows that Danielle’s goal is to have her own family. We approached her with an empty hand when we attempted to track down her personal life because of this worry. Danielle leads a somewhat low-key life, even though she is well-known. She has concealed details of her personal life from the media in addition to her career.</p><p>Consequently, we are unable to determine Trejo’s marital status. She has not disclosed her marital status or dating status to the media. Therefore, it is safe to assume that she is still single as of right now unless and until she discloses more about her family history.</p><h2><span id=Handles_on_Social_Media_by_Danielle_Trejo>Handles on Social Media by Danielle Trejo</span></h2><p>Regarding her online persona on social media platforms, she appears to be somewhat reserved at the moment.
