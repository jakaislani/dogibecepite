The music industry is split into various subgroups with each group big enough to have several artists catering to the needs of their fans. Hip-hop, rock, country music, and all are just some of the subgroups of the larger industry, with each possessing a big enough market for musicians to focus on and earn a decent living. One of those artists is Ashley McBryde.</p><p>McBryde is a singer and songwriter with a primary focus on country music. She has done so well for herself so far in her decade-long career. Learn more about the Arkansas-born country music star by reading below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ashley-mcbrydes-biography></span><strong>Ashley McBryde’s Biography </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ashley is a native of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. She was born there to her parents, William McBryde and Martha Wilkins, on the 29th of July, 1983. Not much is known about the upbringing of the country music star, but her foray into music came when she was a teenager. Using her father’s guitar, she learned how to play the instrument and maintained her interest in it all through college at Arkansas State University, infusing it with her songwriting talent. She has one sibling, a brother named William Clayton McBryde Jr.</p><p>Ashley’s first self-released album was released shortly after graduating from the university. Choosing to focus on country music, she decided to move to the home of country music, Nashville Tennessee, in further pursuit of a career in the genre. While she was there, she contested for and won the Country Showdown competition in 2009 and 2010. She followed up the win&nbsp;with the release of her sophomore album, Elsebound, in 2011. After the album’s release, Ashley McBryde went on a tour of the Southern United States for the promotion of her album and music.</p><p>At the release of her second album which was also self-released<strong>,</strong> Ashley Mcbryde’s career still didn’t really take off but she kept working hard and in 2016, things began to change for her. Ashley released another music project in 2016, five years after her last. It was an EP and she titled it Jalopies & Expensive Guitars. The project was well received among country music fans. The album and her music caught the attention of Eric Church, a country music star and he invited her to perform with him at one of his concerts.</p><p>The exposure and endorsement given to her by one of country music’s biggest names were very beneficial to her career. Ashley McBryde started getting the attention of major music platforms like The New York Times and Rolling Stone. Her follow up single&nbsp;–&nbsp;A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega was considered one of the 54 Best Songs of 2017 by The New York Times and the Top 25 Best of Country Songs in 2017 by Rolling Stone. The song itself brought her first commercial success, peaking at number 30 on the US Country Music chart and selling over 66,000 copies. The song was based on a real-life story of one of the song’s co-writers, a fact which gave further weight to its strength.</p><p>Ashley McBryde was subsequently signed to Warner Bros. Records Nashville in September 2017 and went on to release her first studio album in March 2018 and dubbed it&nbsp;Girl Going Nowhere. The album peaked at number 49 of the US Billboard chart, number 7 on the US country chart and number 4 on the UK country chart. So far, the album has sold over 31,000 copies. For the piece, she partnered with Jay Joyce, who is one of the iconic producers of country music. She, alongside Toby Keith, has been touring the US and other countries like Canada and the UK for the promotion of her album.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-she-married-who-is-the-husband></span><strong>Is She Married, Who Is The Husband? </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about her personal life, especially, her relationships are unknown. Despite her music being one strong in emotion and storytelling, there isn’t a lot of information about the singer’s marital life. Thus, it is not known if she is married and to who.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-are-facts></span><strong>Other Are Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ashley recently lost her brother, William Clayton who died on June 20, 2018. He was a war veteran who left behind a son, grandson and a wife. In continuation of her tendency to keep her life private, Ashley has refrained from sharing details about her brother.</p><p>Ashley has a thick body build and flaunts flowing curly hair. Other details of her body measurements are nowhere near the records.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yaqqGkla56rq%2FBq7CdnV2ewG6%2Fx55kppmip7amsIyapZ1lp528brXSZquhnV2dwrSuwKebaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-marisa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Things You Didnt Know About Marisa Papen">&larr;
